# Webbino

Webbino is a webserver for Arduino.  I originally wrote it for my [SmartStrip
project](https://github.com/SukkoPera/SmartStrip), which required several unique
features which were not present in other webservers that were available at the
time:
- Compatible with many network interfaces:
  - WizNet W5100: [Ethernet Shield](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield)
  - WizNet W5500: [Ethernet Shield 2](http://www.arduino.org/products/shields/arduino-ethernet-shield-2)
  - ENC28J60: [KMTronic DINo](http://sigma-shop.com/product/72/web-internet-ethernet-controlled-relay-board-arduino-compatible-rs485-usb.html) (first version)
  - WINC1500 (Wi-Fi): [WiFi Shield 101](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoWiFiShield101), [MKR1000](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMKR1000) - EXPERIMENTAL, MIGHT NOT WORK!
  - ESP8266 (Wi-Fi): Either as an add-on to Arduino, like the [MLT shield](http://www.mlt-group.com/Products/Wifi-Wireless-Modules/ESP8266-WIFI-Shield-with-ESP-01-ESP-07-ESP-12-for-Arduino), or standalone like [NodeMCU](http://www.nodemcu.com), [WeMos D1](https://www.wemos.cc/product/d1.html)/[D1 Mini](https://www.wemos.cc/product/d1-mini.html), etc...
  - ESP32
- HTML pages and other data can be embedded in the code. This avoids the need of
  an SD card for simple sites.
- If you prefer, HTML pages can also be stored on an SD card (long file names are
  supported!)
- Tags like "#WHATEVER#" in HTML pages can be replaced at page request time,
  allowing the delivery of dynamic contents.
- Arbitrary functions can be associated to a page, to perform any needed
  actions.

Included with Webbino are a lot of examples showing how to use all the different features.

## Supported boards
To switch between the supported chipsets, and to configure various working aspects of the webserver, have a look at the _webbino_config.h_ file: the _WEBBINO_USE\_*_ #defines will enable support for the chosen network interface.

### WizNet W5100
#### &#8594; WEBBINO_USE_WIZ5100
Support for this chip is included in the standard distribution of the Arduino IDE, so it can be used stright away.

### WizNet W5500
#### &#8594; WEBBINO_USE_WIZ5500
This chip is used on the Ethernet Shield 2, originally released by arduino.org. It is supported through the *Ethernet 2* library which can be installed through the Library Manager in the Arduino IDE.

### ENC28J60
The ENC28J60 Ethernet Controller is supported either through the [EtherCard library](https://github.com/jcw/ethercard/) or through the [UIPEthernet library](https://github.com/ntruchsess/arduino_uip).

#### &#8594; WEBBINO_USE_ENC28J60
The former has some limitations and is recommended on microcontrollers/boards with limited resources, such as the Uno. It uses a lot of RAM for the packet buffer, which is currently set at 800 bytes including TCP/IP headers, leaving about 750 bytes for data to be sent to the client. Since the library also forces all communications to be single-packet, about 750 bytes is the maximum size of any data that is exchanged between server and client (i.e.: of webpages).

#### &#8594; WEBBINO_USE_ENC28J60_UIP
The latter library is more complete but even heavier on resource usage, so it is only recommended on more powerful platforms, such as the Arduino Mega, Due or on boards based on STM32 microcontrollers. 

### WINC1500
#### &#8594; WEBBINO_USE_WIFI101
WINC1500 support is obtained through the WiFi101 library that can be installed through the Library Manager. This is currently experimental and might not work.

### ESP8266
ESP8266 is supported either as an add-on to Arduino or standalone:

#### &#8594; WEBBINO_USE_ESP8266
In the former case, you will need Bruno Portaluri's WiFiEsp library available in the Library Manager or at https://github.com/bportaluri/WiFiEsp.

#### &#8594; WEBBINO_USE_ESP8266_STANDALONE
In the latter case you will need to install the ESP8266 core, available at https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino.

### ESP32
#### &#8594; WEBBINO_USE_WIFI
ESP32 is only supported as a standalone board through the [ESP32 core](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32).

## Storing pages
Web pages can be stored in Arduino's flash memory (where code is stored) and/or on an SD card.

### Flash memory
If you only need to serve one or a few pages, storing them together with the code is a great idea, as you will spare your SD card for some better job.

Any file that must be available on the webserver can be converted to a C header file throught a Python script that is available in the "tools" directory. It will also produce some code that you need to include in your sketch. Please have a look at the examples if you need help.

### SD card
If flash space is an issue or if you just prefer to store your pages on an SD card (to make them easily editable, for instance), you are welcome to do so. You will need to enable SD support by uncommenting one of two #defines in _webbino_config.h_:
- WEBBINO_ENABLE_SD: This will use Arduino's SD library, which only allows DOS-style (i.e. 8+3 characters) file names. This implies that you will have to name your pages with a _.htm_ extension, instead of _.html_.
- WEBBINO_ENABLE_SDFAT: This will use the [SDFat library](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat), which allows access to files with long names (LFNs), if properly configured (see _SdFatConfig.h_ in the library sources).

## Replacement Tags
Webbino allows easy embedding of small pieces of dynamic content in webpages. If, for instance, all you have to do is show some instant weather data in an otherwise static page, just use the Tag feature: put placeholders like _#TEMPERATURE#_, _#HUMIDITY#_ and such in your HTML page, and have Webbino replace them with actual data measured when the page is loaded! Have a look at the _ReplacementTags_ example to get started.
